      <h1>Hello Page</h1>
      <p>
      As a Freelance Consultant, Coach and Developer,
      I help customers on site to transform towards
      an agile approach to building working and
      secure Software and Hardware. By working
      together with the existing product team, I can
      focus on building capabilities in the team
      while collaborating on delivering value
        continuously.
      </p>
      <h2>I am an Agile Enthusiast.</h2>
      <p>
      I spend my time continuously delivering
      software and hardware systems using test-first
      methodologies. Working in close collaboration
      with fellow developers, designers, business
      analysts and product owners through pairing and
      on-site teamwork.
      </p>
      <h2>I am a Generalist.</h2>
      <p>
      Throughout the years I have faced challenges of
      product development in a multitude of do mains.
      I’ve developed large scale mobile browser games
      entertaining millions of users.  In addition to
      this I worked on a wide spectrum of industry
      applications, from security critical IoT
      platforms to safety critical bootloaders for
      microcontrollers.
      </p>
      <h2>I am a Pragmatist.</h2>
      <p>
      I truly believe that picking the right tool for
      the job is much more valuable than becoming a
      master of a single trade. Here is a a partial
      list of my skills:

      As a Freelance Consultant, Coach and Software Developer I can help your
      team and your product to become better in delivering working and secure
      software:

      <h2>Hands-On Consulting with a dynamic Focus</h2>
      <p>
      Hands-On Consulting usually happens on-site. I join the team as a fellow developer and sup-
      port them with delivering a working product. While working together, I can identify different
      issues and pain points that can be leveraged to improve various aspects of the process and
      the product being build. Through methodologies like pair programming and leading by ex-
      ample I support the team in establishing practices that will help them to grow even further.
      Here are my main areas of focus:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Agile Methodologies: Pair Programming, Kanban, SCRUM, Retros,
        Stand-Up/Dailies, ...
        </li>
        <li>
        Delivery Performance: CI/CD, Trunk Based Development and Test
        Automation
        </li>
        <li>
        Architecture/Design Assessment: Let’s see how we can even further
        improve existing systems by identifying pivotal pain points
